The image shows a young woman standing on a street with buildings on either side. She is wearing a black crop top and grey sweatpants. She has long dark hair and is smiling at the camera. In her hands, she is making a peace sign with her fingers. The word "ART" is written in red letters on the cap. The background is blurred, but it appears to be a city street with cars and buildings.
